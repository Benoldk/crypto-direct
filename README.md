# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

The Task:

Using the Coingecko public API (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), build an application that will serve as a directory of cryptocurrency exchanges. The main page should be a list with the first ten exchanges with some high-level information (name, country, URL, logo, trust rank).

When the user clicks on an exchange, show its details on a separate page. Included in those details should be the name, country, trust rank, logo, year of establishment, social media links, description, and a back-to-main-page button.

Tech Stack:

As long as the solution is built using React, you can use any other tools you like.

Browser Support:
You should test your work in the latest version of Chrome. If you use any features that are not supported by common browsers or IE 11, you should mention these features and how you would provide a suitable fallback experience if your code does not do so already.

Dependencies:

Please use `npm` for dependency management.

You can use any 3rd-party libraries as necessary or desired, but we prefer the use of minimal dependencies.

Coding Standard:

Your styles should be responsive and mobile-first. Please use ESLint and Prettier to format your code.

Evaluation:

Your React app should build without errors. If there are extra steps required to get it to compile, they should be covered in your README.md.
Your commit history is important to us. Try to make meaningful commit messages that show your progress.
Your code should be easy to understand and communicative (e.g. in comments, variable names, etc). Clean code principles, componentization, appropriate test coverage, and code documentation are key factors and are highly valued.
Bonus points for testing (stakefish ❤️ end-to-end testing with Cypress).

Please aim to return to us your solution, including all the files you would like to share within 3 days.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.


We hope you enjoy this and happy coding!
